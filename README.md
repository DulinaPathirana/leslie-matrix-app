# Leslie Matrix Eigenvalue Calculator (Online)

Search-friendly summary: Free, browser-based Leslie matrix calculator to compute the dominant eigenvalue (lambda, growth rate) and eigenvector (stable age distribution) using the power iteration method. Ideal for demography, ecology, and linear algebra coursework and research.

## What this tool does
- Compute dominant eigenvalue (population growth rate) of a Leslie matrix
- Compute the corresponding eigenvector (stable age distribution)
- Accept data via interactive grid or CSV upload
- Show iterations and results clearly above the matrix

## Why it matters
- Leslie matrices model age-structured population dynamics (fecundity and survival rates)
- The largest eigenvalue (|λ|) indicates long-term growth (>1 grows, =1 stable, <1 declines)
- The associated eigenvector gives the stable age distribution
